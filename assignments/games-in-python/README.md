### 🛠️ Hangman Game Implementation

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should provide an engaging experience with clear feedback and game state tracking.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 10 words
- Accept letter guesses and validate input (single letters only)
- Display current progress using underscores for unguessed letters (_ _ _ format)
- Track and display incorrect guesses remaining (start with 6 attempts)
- Show all previously guessed letters to avoid duplicates
- End the game when the word is completely guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word revealed
- Allow the player to play multiple rounds if desired
